## Overview

![MyUnsplash Preview](https://github.com/varJonathanR/my-unsplash/blob/main/my-unsplash_preview.png)

> [View this repo as if in a code editor](https://github.dev/varJonathanR/my-unsplash)

This fullstack project is a simplified clone of [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/), a platform for sharing high-quality images. It allows registered users to save images using the direct image link from unsplash. The application features a clean and user-friendly design. It utilizes technologies like [Astro](https://astro.build/) for the frontend, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/) for the backend, and a [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) database (locally) or [Turso](https://turso.tech/) (in production) to store information about images and users.

> [!TIP]
> Right click on Unsplash image and click on "Copy Image Address" <br>
> Valid link example: https://images.unsplash.com/photo-(...) <br>

> [!NOTE]
> While the backend functions correctly, there is an issue with Vercel in production where cookies are not saved when redirecting to '/' (this does not happen in the local environment, even using the production API).
